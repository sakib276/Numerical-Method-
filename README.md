# Numerical-Method- <br>
This repository is made for storing implementation code of various rules of Numerical Method using Cpp. <br>
I have tried here to make the code easier . <br>
This repository contains -- <br>
 1. Bisection Method <br>
 2. False Position Method <br>
 3. Newton-Raphson Method <br>
 4. Jacobi Iteration <br>
 5. Gauss Seidal Method <br>
 6. Lagrange Interpolation of Polynomial <br>
 7. Least Square Regression <br>
 8. Trapezoidal Rules of Integration <br>
